## **Spanish summer hits**

### *(A recipe Recipe for the next summer hit)*

### **Initial hypothesis**

We believe that widely popular summer songs in Spain has been following a similar pattern from the last 3 decades, and the songs that meet this criteria tend to become a hit in this country.

### **Our approach**

We analized the most popular summer songs in Spain since 1989 and compare them with other popular song that are not usually perceived as "summer songs".

### **Key takeaways from our analysis**

- `Danceability`, `energy` and `valence` are higher in the Spanish summer songs.
- Spanish summer songs are most likely written in B major (*Si major*), in contrast with the rest of the songs, that are mostly written in C# major (*Do# major*).
- With a 95% confidence, we believe that the traits mentioned above stayed contants without any significant change since the 90s.

### **The  product**

Based on our study, we decided to create a product to help musicians and publishers identify those tracks that can be potential summer hits in Spain. The `Macarenameter` will analize any song or playlist and will let you know which songs would qualify as potential summer hits.
