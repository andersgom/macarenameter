### **Initial hypothesis**

We believe that widely popular summer songs in Spain has been following a similar pattern from the last 3 decades, and the songs that meet this criteria tend to become a hit in this country.

### **Our approach**

We analized the most popular summer songs in Spain since 1989 and compare them with other popular song that are not usually perceived as "summer songs".

### **Key takeaways from our initial analysis**

- `Danceability`, `energy` and `valence` are higher in the Spanish summer songs.
- Spanish summer songs are most likely written in B major (*Si major*), in contrast with the rest of the songs, that are mostly written in C# major (*Do# major*).
